Questions

1) Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain how they work 
   and what the output was.

    The command `wc` outputs the number of lines, words and characters contained in 
    the file.  For the commands.js file, the output was: 41  116 1132 commands.js.
    The `sort` command outputs the file sorted alphabetically by line. The output was the
    commands.js file in alphabetical order.
    The `uniq` command outputs the file with all adjacent duplicate lines removed. 
    The output was the contents of the commands.js file with all adjacent duplicate
    lines removed.

2) Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. 
   Explain what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.

    - I ran the command `sort commands.js | uniq`. First the file was sorted
      alphabetically and then all adjacent duplicates were removed.  A clear example
      of this is, when I first ran sort on commands.js, the two `break;`s displayed
      on lines 6 and 7.  When I ran sort and uniq with the pipe connect, only one
      `break;` is displayed on line 6.

6) 
    function reverseString(string) {
      let array = [] 
      let splitString = string.split(' ')
 
      splitString.forEach((word) => {
        let splitWord = word.split('')
        let reversedWord = splitWord.reverse()
        let newWord = reversedWord.join('')
        array.push(newWord)
    })
       let finalResult = array.join(' ')
       return finalResult
   }
